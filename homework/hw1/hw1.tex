\section{}
Write down the steps of the open list and closed list for every iteration of the A* algorithm on the weighted
graph below. The start nodes are denoted with S and the goal nodes are denoted with G . The value of the
heuristic is next to each node. Track entries on the open and closed lists with the format discussed in lecture:
<state, f , g , backpointer>

 \begin{tikzpicture}[
            > = stealth, % arrow head style
            shorten > = 1pt, % don't touch arrow head to node
            auto,
            node distance = 3cm, % distance between nodes
            semithick % line style
        ]

        ]

\subsection{}
Why $A^*$ did not find the shortest path in problem 1. How can the problem be fixed?

\section{}
Explain why search is not used for sorting tasks in terms of computational efficiency, task complexity, and
heuristics.

\section{}
There are 255,160 possible unique ways to play the game Tic Tac Toe . To explore some of them, draw the
search tree for starting at the game state below. Label winning states with 2, losing states with 0, and draw
states with 1. You are playing as the O s and it is your turn.

\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} 
 \hline
 O & X & O \\
 \hline
 - & X & O  \\ 
 \hline
 - & - & X \\

\end{center}

\subsection{}
Annotate non-terminal search tree nodes with score given by minimax.

\subsection{}
If there are subtrees pruned by alpha-beta minimax, label them as pruned in your search tree.

\subsection{}
What is the best possible outcome for Os and for Xs? What about the worst outcome for each? Are either
likely given if both players used minimax to guide their plays?

\section{}

Given your search subtree for Tic Tac Toe, use UCB1 to find the confidence interval for the subtree. For convenience, here is the UCB1 formula:
\begin{equation}
	\bar{x_i} \pm \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln n}{n_i}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{}
Is MCTS guaranteed to find the best solution in its search? Justify your answer in terms of determinism and stochasticity. If MCTS had fantastically large but finite resources to work with, does the guarantee hold?
